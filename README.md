Winforms project in C#, in which 1000 circle objects are created in such a way so that no circle has intersections with other circles. 
Circle objects can be created wherever on the form and have the same radius.
The program can be ran both sequentially (with 5/20/100 arrays) and in parallel (with 5/20/100 threads).
